# Tower-Of-Hanoi
Basically it is a Mathematical Puzzle in which numbers of pillar or rod were there and number of Disc.
In these puzzle user set the Disc on the rod in increasing order at the top.
I use some logic to solve these puzzle in the programming language.
This is the C language program.
In these Program I use the following:- 1. For Loop (to do the same work for mannt time) , 2. Function(which can make code reusable in the entireprogram) , 3. Recursion(To call the function itself)
In these way we can solve the puzzle.
Note :- Dont use large no of disc because its time consuming and it may generate error in laptop or PC.
